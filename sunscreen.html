<p><font size=5>Applying sunscreen correctly is crucial to ensure maximum protection from the sun’s harmful rays.<br> Here are some tips on how to apply sunscreen effectively:</p>
<ol>
   <li> Apply sunscreen at least 15-30 minutes before going outside to allow it to fully absorb into the skin.</li>
   <li>Use enough sunscreen to cover all exposed skin. A general rule of thumb is to use about<br> one ounce (or a         shot glass full) of sunscreen for the entire body.</li>
   <li> Reapply sunscreen every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating.</li>
   <li>Don’t forget to apply sunscreen to often overlooked areas such as the ears,<br> back of the neck, and tops of           the feet.</li>
   <li>Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to protect against both UVA and UVB rays.</li>
   <li> Consider using a separate facial sunscreen with a higher SPF to protect the delicate skin on your face.</li>

   <ol type=A>
          <li> Apply sunscreen generously: Most people do not apply enough sunscreen, which reduces its                   effectiveness.<br> To ensure maximum protection, apply a generous amount of sunscreen to all<br>                   exposed areas of your skin.
         <li>Reapply sunscreen frequently: Sunscreen wears off over time, especially if you are sweating or swimming.                  To maintain protection, reapply sunscreen every two hours or after swimming or sweating.
